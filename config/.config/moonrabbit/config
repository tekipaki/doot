# Configuration file for moonrabbit file manager
#
# Keybindings are taken from vim
# 'Shift+h' to toggle hidden files (Ctrl+h works too, but some terminals don't pick it up)
# 'r' to refresh display
# '/' will allow for a search
# ':' starts a simple shell prompt so you can cd, mkdir, a few simple commands

# Config:
#
# 	Put all program/file associations between [File Types] and [End]
# 	The full path to the executable along with a '{' goes on one line
# 	The next is a SPACE separated list of filetypes to open with that program
# 		This is read until the new line. If it wraps that is okay, but don't make an extra line.
# 	The filetypes for that program is ended with a closing '}'
#
#	If you want the program to be executed WITHIN the terminal (i.e. vim, text editors, etc):
#		Prefix the full path with a dollar sign '$'
#		This is so that the process can be forked and stdout/err can be redirected correctly 
#
#	Anything outside the []'s aren't read. Blank lines and '#' commented lines are ignored.
